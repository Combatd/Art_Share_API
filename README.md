# First Routes & Controllers
This project demonstrates Rails routing.

## Learning Goals
* Be able to create routes in routes.rb
* Be able to read and understand Rails server error messages
* Know the three places that params come from
* Be able to nest query parameters
* Be able to write controller actions that read from and write to the database
* Know how and when to render errors

## First Routes
1. Setup database with ``` bundle exec rails db:create ```
2. Just for this assignment, add the line 
```config.action_controller.default_protect_from_forgery = false``` 
right after ```config.load_defaults 5.2``` in the config/application.rb file.
3. In config/routes.rb, generate first routes with:
```resources :users```
4. See first 8 routes with ```bundle exec rails routes```
5. Do the following:
* Comment out the resources :users line.
* Write out the eight routes using the route 'matching' syntax. For example: get 'users/:id', to: 'users#show', as: 'user'.
6. Run bundle exec rails routes again and ensure that the routes you've written match exactly the routes generated by the resources helper. NB: you'll probably be missing some names for some of the routes (they're listed in the left-most column); You can name your routes by adding an as option. get 'users/new', to: 'users#new', as: 'new_user'.

7. To give a little background, starting your Rails server creates an instance of a Router. This Router holds instances of Routes that are defined by your routes.rb. When a request comes in, the Router tries to match a Route based on the HTTP method and the url path (it does this with a regular expression, if you know what that is already). The first matched Route then instantiates an instance of the specified controller, and calls the specified action on it.

8. We have our initial routes now and have the endpoints necessary to manage a User resource. Notice though that our routes point to a UsersController, which we don't actually have yet. Nor do we have a User model. We'll add that later, too. Soon!
